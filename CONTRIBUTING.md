## Getting started

**What does "contributing" mean?**

Creating an issue is the simplest form of contributing to a project. Creating a
merge reques is more efficient form of contributing. But there are many ways to
contribute, including the following:

- Updating or correcting documentation
- Feature requests
- Bug reports

If you'd like to learn more about contributing in general, the [Guide to
Idiomatic
Contributing](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/idiomatic-contributing)
has a lot of useful information.

## Issues

### Before creating an issue

Please try to determine if the issue is caused by an underlying library,
and if so, create the issue there. Sometimes this is difficult to know.
We only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to find out.
Oftentimes the readme will have advice about where to go to create issues.

Try to follow these guidelines

- **Investigate the issue**:
- **Check the readme** - oftentimes you will find notes about creating
issues, and where to go depending on the type of issue
- Create the issue in the appropriate repository

### Creating an issue

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give us the
information we need to successfully answer your question or address your
issue by answering the following in your issue:

- **version**: please note the version of apaxy are you using
- **extensions, plugins, helpers, etc** (if applicable): please list any
extensions you're using
- **error messages**: please paste any error messages into the issue, or
a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)

### Closing issues

The original poster or the maintainer's of apaxy may close an issue at
any time. Typically, but not exclusively, issues are closed when:

- The issue is resolved
- The project's maintainers have determined the issue is out of scope
- An issue is clearly a duplicate of another issue, in which case the
duplicate issue will be linked
- A discussion has clearly run its course


## Pull requests

### Before creating a merge request

and if so, create the merge request there. Sometimes this is difficult to know.
We only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to find out.
Oftentimes the readme will have advice about where to go to create merge
requests.

Try to follow these guidelines

- **Investigate the issue**:
- **Check the readme** - oftentimes you will find notes about creating
issues, and where to go depending on the type of issue
- Create the merge request in the appropriate repository

### Creating a merge request

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating a merge request. Give us the
information we need to successfully understand what you want to change or to add
to apaxy. Create the merge request as soon as possible so that the discussion
around your changes can start at the beginning of your work, not when it's over
and you don't time anymore to discuss it.

### Closing merge requests

The original poster or the maintainer's of apaxy may close a merge request at
any time. Typically, but not exclusively, issues are closed when:

- The merge request has conflict with the develop branch that makes it difficult
to merge without a hard work
- The commit message of each commit of the merge request does not follow the
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard
- The project's maintainers have determined the merge request is out of scope
- A merge request is clearly a duplicate of another merge request, in which case
the duplicate merge request will be linked
- A discussion has clearly run its course


## Next steps

**Tips for creating idiomatic issues**

Spending just a little extra time to review best practices and brush up
on your contributing skills will, at minimum, make your issue easier to
read, easier to resolve, and more likely to be found by others who have
the same or similar issue in the future. At best, it will open up doors
and potential career opportunities by helping you be at your best.

The following resources were hand-picked to help you be the most
effective contributor you can be:

- The [Guide to Idiomatic
Contributing](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/idiomatic-contributing)
is a great place for newcomers to start, but there is also information
for experienced contributors there
- Take some time to learn basic markdown. We can't stress this enough.
Don't start pasting code into GitHub issues before you've taken a moment
to review this [markdown
cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/5854601)
- The GitHub guide to [basic
markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) is another
great markdown resource
- Learn about [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
And if you want to really go above and beyond, read [mastering
markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

At the very least, please try to:

- Use backticks to wrap code. This ensures that it retains its
formatting and isn't modified when it's rendered by GitHub, and makes
the code more readable to others
- When applicable, use syntax highlighting by adding the correct
language name after the first "code fence"
